This book is the second in a series of R books I’ve been working on. The first in the series (teacheR) focuses on the fundamentals of the R language. I would recommend reading teacheR first if you’re brand new to the language. It’s split into two parts (“For Students” and “For Teachers”). To get the most out of this book, I would suggest that you are at least comfortable with the entirety of the “For Students” section, but it wouldn’t hurt to go through the “For Teachers” section while you’re at it. As with the teacheR book, this is a work in progress, so please feel free to make any suggestions or corrections via this book’s GitHub repository. 1.1.1 Acknowledgements This book was made possible with the help of those who raised issues and proposed pull requests. With thanks to: "],["about-me.html", "1.2 About Me", " 1.2 About Me I began using R in my second year of university, whilst studying psychology. Like so many others before me, I started using R for a particular project - in my case, it was for an analysis of publication bias - before deciding that I wanted to expand my skillset and learn to apply R to lots of different situations. Because I took this approach however, I didn’t really develop a fundamental knowledge of how R worked before I started - I just kind of jumped in at the deep end. As a quick analogy, it was a bit like starting with this book without reading the teacheR book first - I kind of knew what was going on, but I was filling in a lot of gaps along the way. And so that is why I decided to develop this series of books - to hopefully help anyone who may find themselves in a similar position that I was in those years ago. If you want to use R but feel as though you don’t know where to start, then hopefully this book will give you a good overview of some of the different ways that R can be used or applied. "],["using-r.html", "1.3 Using R", " 1.3 Using R In my primary years, analysis in R took me longer than it would take to do the same analysis in something like Excel. And that’s okay. R is a complicated and flexible system, and so your first analysis piece will never be particularly efficient. As you stick with it however, and you get used to the methods of automation and a pipeline of execution, you’ll find yourself working much more efficiently, performing analyses in half the time. And that’s what I hope I can impart with this book; it’ll be slow at first, but you’ll notice a turning point when you complete your first analysis project in a decent timescale and you’ll never look back. Then, before long, you’ll have a repertoire of analysis tools at your disposal that make you a crucial member of any data analysis team. And so in this book we’re going to look at some of the common tasks that one might decide to do in R. Keep in mind though that we can’t cover everything, so just because it’s not in the book doesn’t mean that it can’t be done! "],["projects.html", "2 Projects", " 2 Projects In this section, we’re going to look at the best way to plan and structure your project. Not all of your analyses will be of sufficient size to warrant a big planning stage, but learning to use a common, separate structure for all of your different projects can really help keep your work clean. This becomes even more important when you begin to combine multiple projects and you want to make sure that they don’t slowly start to creep into one. For example, imagine you’ve previously worked on a project that relied heavily on API data. Then, in your next project, you need to use much of the same data but to a very different end. By utilising this project structure (and more specifically, the idea of “Projects as packages”), you’ll be able to easily utilise work from previous projects without duplicating or merging code. "],["workflows.html", "2.1 Workflows", " 2.1 Workflows Often the best way to start a data analysis project is to decide what you’re workflow should be and roughly how long each bit is going to take. For instance, if you know that the data you’re going to be working on is likely to be littered with mistakes and errors, then you should preemptively allocate a decent amount of your time to the “importing” and “cleaning” steps of your workflow. Similarly, if you’re end goal is to produce a predictive model at the end, then work in a feedback loop where you inspect and evaluate your model before improving it in the next iteration. Later on we’re going to look at a set of packages called the tidyverse. These packages are designed to make data science easier, and the workflows we’ll look at fit into this philosophy quite nicely. Each stage of these workflows is usually handled by a different package but with a common syntax and data structure underpinning them all. If you want to better understand the tidyverse before we look at the workflows, then skip ahead to the tidyverse section. 2.1.1 Basic Workflow For now, let’s look at a basic workflow and some likely additions or changes you might make depending on your goals. For these basic workflows, we’re only going to look at a subset of all of the stages of analysis that you might identify. They are going to be: Importing Cleaning Tidying Summarising Plotting Modelling Evaluation 2.1.1.1 Example 1: Reporting In this example, imagine someone has come to you and they want a bit more insight into the data they have. It’s currently in a messy spreadsheet, and they want you to load it into R and produce some nice looking graphics to help them understand trends and correlations in their data. They’re not bothered about any modelling for now, they just want some pretty graphs. If we mapped out an appropriate workflow for this project, it might look something like this: We import the data and clean it, then we summarise it and create our plots. We can then use feedback from our colleague to change how we’re summarising or how we’re plotting the data to improve our plots until we’re happy. 2.1.1.2 Example 2: Modelling For this example, imagine a colleague has come to you about a modelling project. They have a number of relatively clean datasets that they want to combine and use to produce a predictive model. They’re not too worried about plots or graphics, they’re more interested in the model itself. Our workflow here would be similar to Example 1 but there would be some crucial differences. First, we know that we’re going to combine multiple datasets into one which we will then use for our model. This is likely going to involve some data manipulation or ‘tidying’. Back to Example 2, if we mapped out a workflow for this project, it might look a bit more like this: As you can see, we still end with the loop of modelling and then evaluating our model and using the output to update the model, but the steps we take to get there are a bit different. 2.1.1.3 Summary Hopefully this section has given you an idea of what a typical project workflow could look like. The benefit of splitting your project into these distinct steps is that it can often help you compartmentalise your functions and scripts into distinct stages. We’ll look later at structuring your project like an R package, and so splitting your analysis into separate stages can help you construct your project in a portable and replicable way. "],["replicability.html", "2.2 Replicability", " 2.2 Replicability The key to a good, robust analysis is replicability. When we say ‘replicability’, we mean two things: That your results can be replicated in other populations and in other settings (i.e. typical ‘scientific’ replicability) That you can easily share your code and method with others who can verify your outputs If your project is replicable, then it’s likely to have fewer issues, make fewer dodgy assumptions, and rely less on the idiosyncracies of your environment or coding practice. That doesn’t mean that everything that you do that can be replicated is immediately correct, but it’s a useful credential to have. For now, we’re going to focus on how you can make your code more replicable. By that I mean, how you can share your results and your code with others either in your business or instution or even in the open source community in general. 2.2.1 Good practice There are a few things you can do to make your work immediately more readable for others: 2.2.1.1 Use a consistent naming convention Take your pick. Everyone has their preference and that’s okay. If you like camelCase then go with camelCase. If you like the _ approach, then go for that. The most important part of your naming convention however is that it’s stable. Don’t name some of your functions like_this and the rest likeThis. Not only does it make it harder to read, but every time you do it, a kitten dies. So be consistent. 2.2.1.2 Name your variables as nouns and your functions as verbs Functions do and variables and objects are. Almost all languages share this distinction with verbs and nouns, so utilise that natural divide to improve how you name your functions and variables. Aim to give your functions names that suggest that they do something; and bonus points if you can give it a name that’s a verb and also gives a decent description of what the function does. When you name your variables, give them meaningful noun-like names. Say you’re doing some climate analysis, a good name for the variable that holds the average rainfall in a year might be avg_yearly_rainfall whilst a function that converts a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit might be convert_degrees(). 2.2.1.3 Use functions where you can R is a functional language and so using and creating functions is at the very heart of programming in R. Rather than relying on R scripts that need to be run in their entirety to produce your output, by creating functions and using them in your analysis, you can more easily scale your project. For example, imagine your scope is initially to produce a report for the year. Then, after your done, your manager is so impressed with your report, they want you to do the same thing for the last 10 years. If you’ve used a couple of R scripts and you haven’t written any functions, then this is likely going to involve copying and pasting a whole lot of code and changing the years. Instead, if you use functions to perform your analysis, then creating reports for multiple years can be as simple as changing your dataset. Later on we’ll look at the concept of abstraction - removing levels of complexity to focus on the core operation - and this tip is heavily related to that concept. For now though, keep this thought in mind: If you find yourself copying and pasting your R code more than twice to do very similar things, you should probably be using a function. 2.2.1.4 State your dependencies One of the great things about R is the number of packages that are available that let you do all sorts of weird and wonderful things. Unfortunately, because there are so many great packages, it’s unlikely that the person you’re sharing your code with will have them all installed. If you’re sending someone a script, then best practice is to include all the packages you use at the top of your script like this: library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) An extra step which few people do but can be very helpful is to still prepend your functions with which package they came from like this dplyr::mutate(). Not only does this avoid any namespace conflicts where two packages might have functions with the same name and you don’t end up using the one you think you are because of the order of your library() calls, but it also makes it infinitely easier for anyone reading your code to find the package that a function comes from. Admittedly, this is overkill in a sense because we’ve already told R which packages we’re using with our library() calls, but this practice can really improve the readability of your code. Later we’ll look at designing our project as a package and packages have a different way of stating dependencies for the user, so this is primarily for the case where you’re just sending a script or two to someone. 2.2.2 Documentation When you’re working on a project, never think that you’ll remember everything when you come back to it. You won’t. Instead, imagine you’re always writing for code for someone who’s never seen it before, because, trust me, when you come back to a project after 6 months you’ll have absolutely no idea what you’re looking at. At the heart of writing code that’s easy to understand is documentation. Here we’ll talk about the two main types of documentation. 2.2.2.1 Function documentation To get a package on CRAN, all the functions that your package exports needs to be documented. So if you type, say, ?dplyr::mutate() into the console and hit Enter, you’ll be taken to the Help page for the mutate function. This ensures that the package users are not left guessing what a parameter is supposed to be, or what they’re going to get returned from the function. Even if you’re not ever planning on submitting your work to CRAN, function documentation is extremely useful. The roxygen package makes this documentation as easy as possible for package developers, and you can use the same principles in your analysis. At the very least, you should be documentating the input variables (the @param tag in roxygen), your return value(s) (the @return tag) and maybe an example or two (the @examples tag). This will make explaining your code to someone else or relearning it yourself infinitely easier. 2.2.2.2 Long-form documentation Whilst understanding what each of your functions does is important, it’s also important to document how all of the little pieces fit together. To acheive this, it’s a good idea to write some long-form documentation, like a README or a vignette. Long form-documentation is often written in something called RMarkdown. RMarkdown is a spin on markdown that allows you to embed and run R code when generating a document. This can be really useful for explaining your process and sharing your workings. 2.2.2.2.1 READMEs READMEs act as an entrypoint for anyone that stumbles across your package. It should be in the root of your project directory, and should be written in markdown or plain text. Anyone should be able to read your README and understand what the project is doing. I won’t go into exactly what should be included because it will depend on the type of project your doing, but you know a good README when you see it. If you also use a repository system like GitHub, your README will act as the homepage and so should always be present. ## Projects as packages 2.2.2.2.2 Vignettes Vignettes are less defined that READMEs. Vignettes should be an in-depth form of documentation for a concept in your project. For example, say that your project is looking at the level of data quality of various open source APIs. You might have a few different vignettes covering different important concepts in your project: Background This would cover why the how the project came to be, and what the ultimate goal is. Selection of APIs Why were certain APIs chosen and others excluded? That would be explained here. Methodology How are you assessing data quality? Here you would explain your different tests and standards. Whilst a README serves as a general introduction to the project, vignettes more often serve as in-depth descriptions of certain aspects of the project. Like READMEs, vignettes should be written in markdown (or more likely RMarkdown). "],["projects-as-packages.html", "2.3 Projects as Packages", " 2.3 Projects as Packages To make a good, replicable and easy to understand project, you need a few things: A clear structure Easily replicable code (e.g. consistent functions and clear dependencies) Good documentation (functional and long-form) Maybe a test or two if you want to be confident in your functions and findings While you could easily fulfill all of these criteria with a standard RStudio project, there’s already a type of project that conforms to these standards: Packages. While packages are primarily meant for collating and distributing new functionality, we can utilise the package structure and some of the tools that come along with package development to make our project easier to understand. To better understand what a package is and how they are developed and maintained, I would recommend reading Hadley and Jenny Bryan’s R Packages book book. Although that book is focused directly on developing packages for submission to CRAN, hopefully you’ll be able to identify the parts that are going to be applicable to the way we’re using packages. 2.3.1 Structure 2.3.1.1 R code The structure of R files in a package is pretty simple. Everything goes in the root of the R folder. That means no subfolders. There are also some filenames that should be avoided for normal packages, but we won’t worry too much about that for now. When you then run the devtools::load_all() command, all of the files in this folder and then loaded (as if you’ve loaded any other package via library()). This means you can make quick changes to your code and then run devtools::load_all() to bring those changes into your current environment. This helps prevent working on data or functions that are out of date (which often happens when you’re manually sourcing R files). 2.3.1.2 Data For some projects, you’ll want to include a static dataset or datasets that you’re basing your analysis on. Packages also have a way of including data in a standard way. Use the usethis::use_data() function to bundle an R object with your package. You can make sure that the data needed for your project is included with it. For other projects, you’ll want to use the latest data whenever the analysis is done. For this, I would recommend creating a set of functions to get your data and including those in the package. That will ensure that getting the data needed for your analysis is as simple as possible for people reading your code. 2.3.2 Documentation 2.3.2.1 Functional To document your functions, I would highly recommend the roxygen package. It’s by far the easiest way to document your functions. Once you’ve documentated your functions, you can run devtools::document() to automatically generate the documentation that will be seen when someone visits the help page for your function (e.g. via ?your_function). 2.3.2.2 Long-form For your long-form documentation, the usethis::use_readme() function will provide you with a template for you to build your README. For vignettes, the usethis::use_vignette() function will create the appropriate file and folder for you, so you can just focus on writing. 2.3.3 DESCRIPTION Every package you download will have a DESCRIPTION file. This file has a number of fields, like who the author is, what license the content is under, and so on. We can utilize many of the fields to help document our project. For example, the Description and Title field are just as relevant for a package-project. Equally, we can use the Version field to keep track of different iterations of our analysis. We can also use this file to state our dependencies. 2.3.3.1 Dependencies Every package will have an entry called Imports in its DESCRIPTION file. Here, the author is stating every other package that’s needed for this package to run. So we can use that same field to state all of the packages that are required for our analysis. That way, when someone installs our package to replicate or check our analysis, all the appropriate dependencies can be installed at the same time. 2.3.4 Abstraction When I was younger, I wrote a package to create a kind of financial stability report. The report essentially used a number of APIs to pull in macroeconomic data and then create an RMarkdown report displaying the data. Then, a few months later, I started another analysis that used very much the same kind of data but for a different purpose. Now, there were three things I could do: Copy all the code used to get the API data from the original project into the new one Put the original project as a dependency of the new project, importing all of the API data but also all of the other functions Abstract the functions used to get the data from the original project into a new package, and then have both projects use that as dependency. Given that the title of this section is “Abstraction”, what do you think I went with? Structuring your analysis in this way helps you re-use or repurpose code in the future without having to copy and paste or duplicate any of your previous work. "],["data-analysis.html", "3 Data Analysis", " 3 Data Analysis In Chapter 8, we’ll look more specifically at how one might do some simple data analysis in R. For a more in-depth view, I would highly recommend Hadley’s R4DS. "],["tidyverse.html", "3.1 tidyverse", " 3.1 tidyverse As we learnt in the teacheR book, R is supported by thousands of packages that provide extra functionality to the base R experience. One of the most popular sets of packages developed by Hadley Wickham and the RStudio Team is called the tidyverse. The tidyverse is made up of packages designed for data science work that are all underpinned by a common philosophy and a common syntax. At the core of this philosophy is the concept of “tidiness” in data. The tidyverse is a set of opinionated packages. That means that there’s (usually) a right way to do things with the package, and there’s a wrong way. There’s much debate in the R community as to whether relying heavily on opinionated external packages such as those included in the tidyverse is a good thing. Personally, I think that the packages included in the tidyverse are fantastic, and are a large reason why R is thriving today. So in this book, we’re a tidyverse family, and we’ll be using the tidyverse packages throughout. 3.1.1 “Tidy” data The concept of “tidy” data is something that’s important throughout the set of tidyverse packages. There is an in-depth paper published in the Journal of Statistical Software, authored by Hadley Wickham, that describes the concept and requirements of tidy data in full. But for now we’re just going to look at the basics. In order for a dataset to be tidy, it needs to abide by three rules: 1. Every column is a variable 2. Every row is an observation 3. Every cell is a single value If a dataset doesn’t abide by all three of these rules, then it’s a “messy” dataset. The benefit of having your data in a tidy format is fairly simple; it provides a standard for structuring a dataset. This means that tools can be developed with the assumption that the data will be in a specific format, making the development of these data science tools easier. And this is essentially what underpins the entire tidyverse: get your data in a tidy format and you’ll have access to everything the tidyverse provides. 3.1.2 Exceptions Whilst I would wholeheartedly recommend that you coerce your data to a tidy structure whenever possible, there are some instances where this won’t be the easiest solution for the analysis that you’re doing. For instance, the base functions in R weren’t designed specifically to work with “tidy” data, meaning you might find yourself tidying your data for use in the tidyverse, then untidying it again to use a base R package. And although there are tidyverse implementation of almost every single base R function and more than are designed specifically for tidy datasets, there will always be times where tidy != easy. My advice in these situations is to prioritise the pragmatic over the philosophical - if you find yourself reshaping your data 20 times because it keeps becoming untidy and Adam told you that tidy is best and so you think you need to tidy it up again, stop and think whether this is really the best way of doing things. "],["loading-data.html", "3.2 Loading data", " 3.2 Loading data The first step in any data analysis project you’ll undertake is getting at least one dataset. Oftentimes, we have less control over the data we use than we would like; receiving odd Excel spreadsheets or text files or proprietary files or whatever. In this chapter, we’ll focus on the more typical data formats (csv and Excel), but we’ll also look at how we might extract data from a web API, which is an increasingly common method for data loading. 3.2.1 csv If I have any say in the data format of the files I need to load in, I usually ask for them to be in csv format. CSV stands for “comma-separated values” and essentially means that the data is stored as one long text string, with each different value or cell separated by a comma. So for example, a really simple csv file may look, in its most base format, like this: name,age, Dave,35, Simon,60, Anna,24, Patricia,75 Benefits of the csv file over something like an Excel file are largely based around simplicity. csv files are typically smaller and can only have one sheet, meaning that you won’t get confused with multiple spreadsheets. Furthermore, values in csv files are essentially what you see is what you get. With Excel files, sometimes the value that you see in Excel isn’t the value that ends up in R (looking at you dates and datetimes). For these reasons, I would suggest using a separated-value file over an Excel file when you can. 3.2.1.1 Loading .csv files Loading csv files in R is relatively simple. There are base* functions that come with R to load csv files but there’s also a popular package called readr which can be used so I’ll cover both. * They are technically from the utils package which comes bundled with R so we’ll call it base R. 3.2.1.1.1 Base To load a csv file using base R, we’ll use the read.csv() function: read.csv(file = &quot;path/to/your/file&quot;, header = TRUE, ...) The file parameters needs the path to your file as a character string. The header parameter is used to tell R whether or not your file has column headers. There are lots of other parameters that can be tweaked for the read.csv() function, but we won’t go through them here. 3.2.1.1.2 readr The readr package comes with a similar function: read_csv(). With the exception of a couple of extra parameters in the read_csv() function and potentially some better efficiency, there isn’t a massive difference between the two. Using the read_csv() function is simple: readr::read_csv(file = &quot;path/to/your/file&quot;, col_names = TRUE) In this function, the header parameter is replaced with the col_names parameter. The col_names parameter is very similar, you can say whether your dataset has column headings, or you can provide a character vector of names to be used as column headers. There are also some extra parameters in the read_csv() function that can be useful. The col_types parameter lets you specify what datatype each column should be treated as. This can either be provided using the cols() helper function like this: readr::read_csv(file = &quot;path/to/file&quot;, col_names = TRUE, col_types = readr::cols( readr::col_character(), readr::col_double() ), ... ) Or, you can provide a compact string with different letters representing different datatypes: readr::read_csv(file = &quot;path/to/file&quot;, col_names = TRUE, col_types = &quot;cd&quot;, ... ) The codes for the different datatypes can be found on the documentation page for the read_csv() function (type ?read_csv()). The trim_ws parameter can also be helpful if you have a dataset with lots of trailing whitespace around your values. When set to true, the read_csv() function will automatically trim each field before loading it in. Overall, both functions will give you the same result, so just choose whichever function makes most sense to you and has the parameters you need. 3.2.2 Excel files R doesn’t have any built-in functions to load Excel files. Instead, you’ll need to use a package. One of the more popular packages used to read Excel files is the readxl package. Once you’ve installed and loaded the readxl package. You can use the read_excel() function: readxl::read_excel(path = &quot;path/to/file&quot;, sheet = NULL, range = NULL, ...) Because Excel files are a little bit more complicated than csv files, you’ll notice that there are some extra parameters. Most notably, the sheet and range parameters can be used to define a subset of the entire Excel file to be loaded. By default, both are set to NULL, which will mean that R will load the entirety of the first sheet. Like the readr::read_csv() function, you can specify column names and types using the col_names and col_types parameters respectively, and also trim your values using trim_ws. 3.2.3 Using APIs Loading static data from text and Excel files is very common. However, an emerging method of data extraction is via web-based APIs. These web-based APIs allow a user to extract datasets from larger repositories using just an internet connection. This allows for access to larger and more dynamic datasets. 3.2.3.1 What are APIs? API stands for application programming interface. APIs are essentially just a set of functions for interacting with an application or service. For instance, many of the packages that you’ll use will essentially just be forms of API; they provide you with functions to interact with an underlying system or service. For data extraction, we’re going to focus more specifically on web-based APIs. These APIs use URL strings to accept function calls and parameters and then return the data requested. Whilst there are multiple methods that can be implemented in an API to perform different actions, we’re going to focus on GET functions. That is, we’re purely getting something from the API rather than trying to change anything that’s stored on the server. You can think of the GET method as being read-only. To start with, we’re going to look at exactly how you would interact with an API, but then we’ll look at the BMRSr package, which I wrote to make interacting with the Balancing Mechanism and Reporting Service easier. 3.2.3.2 Accessing APIs in R To access a web-based API in R, we’re going to need a connection to the internet, the httr package and potentially some log in credentials for the API. In this case, we’re going to just use a test API, but in reality, most APIs require that you use some kind of authentication so that they know who’s accessing their data. As previously mentioned, to extract something from the API, you’ll be using the GET method. The httr package makes this super easy by providing a GET function. To this function, we’ll need to provide a URL. The GET function will then send a GET request to that address and return the response. A really simple GET request could be: httr::GET(url = &quot;http://google.com&quot;) ## Response [http://www.google.com/] ## Date: 2021-09-03 12:33 ## Status: 200 ## Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1 ## Size: 12.9 kB ## &lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/WebPage&quot; lang=&quot;... ## var f=this||self;var h,k=[];function l(a){for(var b;a&amp;&amp;(!a.getAttribute||!(b=... ## function n(a,b,c,d,g){var e=&quot;&quot;;c||-1!==b.search(&quot;&amp;ei=&quot;)||(e=&quot;&amp;ei=&quot;+l(d),-1===... ## google.y={};google.sy=[];google.x=function(a,b){if(a)var c=a.id;else{do c=Mat... ## document.documentElement.addEventListener(&quot;submit&quot;,function(b){var a;if(a=b.t... ## &lt;/style&gt;&lt;style&gt;body,td,a,p,.h{font-family:arial,sans-serif}body{margin:0;over... ## if (!iesg){document.f&amp;&amp;document.f.q.focus();document.gbqf&amp;&amp;document.gbqf.q.fo... ## } ## })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;mngb&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=gbar&gt;&lt;nobr&gt;&lt;b class=gb1&gt;Search&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a cl... ## else top.location=&#39;/doodles/&#39;;};})();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;input value=&quot;ALs-wAMAAAAAYTIkG... ## ... That seems like a really complicated response at first, but when we look at each part, it’s quite simple. Response This is telling us where we got our response from. In this case, we sent a request to Google, so we got a response from Google. Date Fairly self-explanatory - the date and time of the response. Content-Type This is telling us what type the response is. In this case, the response is just a HTML page, which is exactly what we expect as that’s what you get when you type “google.com” into your browser. Size This is the size of the response Content Below the size, we see the actual response body. In this case, we’ve been given the html for the google.com page. As simple as this example was, it didn’t really give us anything interesting back, just the Google homepage. So let’s use the GET request to get something more interesting. We’re going to access the jsonplaceholder website, which provides fake APIs for testing. But for now, imagine that this is something like an Instagram database, holding users and their posts and comments. The first step in accessing an API is to understand that commands the API is expecting. APIs will have what we call endpoints. These are paths that we can use to access a certain dataset. For instance, looking at the website, we can see that there are endpoints for lots of different types of data: posts, comments, albums, photos, todos and users. To access an endpoint, we just need to make sure we’re using the correct path. So let’s try getting a list of users: httr::GET(url = &quot;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users&quot;) ## Response [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users] ## Date: 2021-09-03 12:33 ## Status: 200 ## Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 ## Size: 5.64 kB ## [ ## { ## &quot;id&quot;: 1, ## &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Leanne Graham&quot;, ## &quot;username&quot;: &quot;Bret&quot;, ## &quot;email&quot;: &quot;Sincere@april.biz&quot;, ## &quot;address&quot;: { ## &quot;street&quot;: &quot;Kulas Light&quot;, ## &quot;suite&quot;: &quot;Apt. 556&quot;, ## &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Gwenborough&quot;, ## ... Looking at the content type, we can see that unlike when we sent a request to Google.com, we’ve got a Content-Type of application/json. JSON is a data structure often used to send data across APIs. We won’t go into the structure of it now because R does most of the conversion for us, but if you’re interested, there’s more info on the JSON structure at www.json.org. Trying to read raw JSON is hard, but httr includes functions to help us get it into a better structure for R. Using the httr::content() function, httr will automatically read the response content and convert it into the format we ask for (via the as parameter). For now, we’re going to leave the at parameter as ‘NULL’ which guesses the best format for us. response &lt;- httr::GET(url = &quot;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users&quot;) content &lt;- httr::content(response) head(content, 1) # we&#39;ll just look at the first entry for presentation sake ## [[1]] ## [[1]]$id ## [1] 1 ## ## [[1]]$name ## [1] &quot;Leanne Graham&quot; ## ## [[1]]$username ## [1] &quot;Bret&quot; ## ## [[1]]$email ## [1] &quot;Sincere@april.biz&quot; ## ## [[1]]$address ## [[1]]$address$street ## [1] &quot;Kulas Light&quot; ## ## [[1]]$address$suite ## [1] &quot;Apt. 556&quot; ## ## [[1]]$address$city ## [1] &quot;Gwenborough&quot; ## ## [[1]]$address$zipcode ## [1] &quot;92998-3874&quot; ## ## [[1]]$address$geo ## [[1]]$address$geo$lat ## [1] &quot;-37.3159&quot; ## ## [[1]]$address$geo$lng ## [1] &quot;81.1496&quot; ## ## ## ## [[1]]$phone ## [1] &quot;1-770-736-8031 x56442&quot; ## ## [[1]]$website ## [1] &quot;hildegard.org&quot; ## ## [[1]]$company ## [[1]]$company$name ## [1] &quot;Romaguera-Crona&quot; ## ## [[1]]$company$catchPhrase ## [1] &quot;Multi-layered client-server neural-net&quot; ## ## [[1]]$company$bs ## [1] &quot;harness real-time e-markets&quot; We can see that R has taken the response and turned it into a list for us. From here, we can then start our analysis. In many cases however, you won’t want a complete list. Instead, you’ll want to provide some parameters to limit the data you get back from your endpoint. Most APIs will have a way of doing this. For example, reading the jsonplaceholder website, we can see that we can get all the posts for a specific user by appending the url with “?userId=x”. This section of the URL (things after a ?) are called the query part of the URL. So let’s try getting all of the posts for the user with ID 1: response &lt;- httr::GET(url = &quot;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1&quot;) content &lt;- httr::content(response) head(content, 1) # we&#39;ll just look at the first entry for presentation sake ## [[1]] ## [[1]]$userId ## [1] 1 ## ## [[1]]$id ## [1] 1 ## ## [[1]]$title ## [1] &quot;sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit&quot; ## ## [[1]]$body ## [1] &quot;quia et suscipit\\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto&quot; Whilst the parameters here are pretty simple, you will come across APIs that accept multiple parameters, making data extraction from an API a very powerful tool. 3.2.3.3 BMRSr As easy as the above was, interacting with APIs that have several parameters and complicated URLs can get confusing. To this end, many people create packages in R that act as wrappers for various APIs. These packages will then provide you with functions that will automatically create the request, send it and receive and parse the content. You can kind of think about it as an API for an API! This is what I did for the Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service (BMRS) API. BMRS provides a massive amount of energy-related data, but creating the correct URLs and dealing with the response can be tricky. The BMRSr package that I wrote was designed to help with that. We’ll now go through a quick demo of the BMRSr package. If you’re not too bothered about this part, feel free to skip to the next section. If you’re interested, there are a couple of things you’ll need: The BMRSr package installed A free BMRS API key that can be retrieved from the ELEXON portal. Once you’ve got those two prerequisites, using BMRSr should be quite easy. The main function in the BMRSr package is the full_request() function, which will create your URL, send the request, and parse the response depending on your parameters. To do this however, the full_request() function needs some parameters: data_item A data item to retrieve. The BMRS platform holds lots of datasets, and so we need to specify which one we want to retrieve. api_key Our API_key that we got from the Elexon portal parameters Depending on which data_item you chose, you’ll need to provide some parameters to filter the data service_type What format you want the data returned in: values are XML or csv. So what parameters do I need? Well, the easiest way to find out is to use the get_parameters() function. This will return all of the parameters that can be provided to the full_request(). Let’s do an example. Say I want to return data for the B1620 data item, which shows us aggregated generation output per type. So, the first step is to know what parameters I can provide using the get_parameters() function: BMRSr::get_parameters(&quot;B1620&quot;) ## [1] &quot;settlement_date&quot; &quot;period&quot; This tells me that I can provide two parameters in my request - the date and the settlement period. Using this information in my full_request() function… bmrs_data &lt;- BMRSr::full_request(data_item = &quot;B1620&quot;, api_key = &quot;put_your_API_key_here&quot;, service_type = &quot;csv&quot;, settlement_date = &quot;01/11/2019&quot;, period = &quot;*&quot;) # From reading the API manual, # I know that this returns all periods head(bmrs_data, 2) ## # A tibble: 2 x 13 ## `*Document Type` `Business Type` `Process Type` `Time Series ID` Quantity ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Actual generati… Production Realised NGET-EMFIP-AGPT… 1636 ## 2 Actual generati… Production Realised NGET-EMFIP-AGPT… 0 ## # … with 8 more variables: `Curve Type` &lt;chr&gt;, Resolution &lt;chr&gt;, `Settlement ## # Date` &lt;date&gt;, `Settlement Period` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Power System Resource ## # Type` &lt;chr&gt;, `Active Flag` &lt;chr&gt;, `Document ID` &lt;chr&gt;, `Document ## # RevNum` &lt;dbl&gt; And there we have it, we’ve retrieved a energy-related dataset from an API using the BMRSr package. There are roughly 101 data items available on BMRS so there’s a massive amount of data there for those who want to access it. "],["cleaning-data.html", "3.3 Cleaning data", " 3.3 Cleaning data Loading data is often just the first step in your project. Most of the time, you’ll have messy datasets with odd columns and missing data points that you’ll need to deal with before you can actually do any meaningful analysis: you’ll need to clean your data. Here are some of the more common operations that you’ll be doing when it comes to data cleaning: Removing/replacing missing values Changing column types Combining columns Renaming columns Checking for anomalies Let’s look at how we might do these tasks in R using the datasets::airquality dataset as an example. head(datasets::airquality, 10) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 ## 6 28 NA 14.9 66 5 6 ## 7 23 299 8.6 65 5 7 ## 8 19 99 13.8 59 5 8 ## 9 8 19 20.1 61 5 9 ## 10 NA 194 8.6 69 5 10 3.3.1 Missing values Missing values are common in data science - data collection is often imperfect and so you’ll end up with observations or data-points missing. Firstly, you need to decide what you’re going to do with those. The easiest approach to just to remove them, and we can do that with the dplyr::filter() function: ## To remove rows with NA in one column datasets::airquality %&gt;% dplyr::filter(!is.na(Ozone)) %&gt;% head(5) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 28 NA 14.9 66 5 6 ## To remove rows with NA in any column datasets::airquality %&gt;% dplyr::filter(dplyr::across(dplyr::everything(), ~!is.na(.x))) %&gt;% head(5) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 23 299 8.6 65 5 7 Another approach to replace them with either the average for that column or with the closest neighbour value (this works better with time series data). To replace with the nearest value, we can use the tidyr::fill() function: ## Fill a single column datasets::airquality %&gt;% tidyr::fill(Ozone, .direction = &quot;downup&quot;) %&gt;% head(5) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 18 NA 14.3 56 5 5 datasets::airquality %&gt;% tidyr::fill(dplyr::everything(), .direction = &quot;downup&quot;) %&gt;% head(5) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 18 313 14.3 56 5 5 To replace them with the mean, we can either use a package like zoo, or we can use the tidyverse packages and our own function: replace_with_mean &lt;- function(x) { replace(x, is.na(x), mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) } datasets::airquality %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(dplyr::everything(), replace_with_mean)) %&gt;% head(5) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41.00000 190.0000 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36.00000 118.0000 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12.00000 149.0000 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18.00000 313.0000 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 42.12931 185.9315 14.3 56 5 5 A word of warning here, however. If you’re doing complex modelling or very sensitive analyses, filling values like this can be misleading at best. Always think about the best approach for your specific project and what the repercussions of filling empty values might be. 3.3.2 Changing column types When you import data into R, sometimes the type of the column doesn’t match what you want it to be. One way of tackling this is to define your column types when you import the data (as we looked at before), but it’s also perfectly acceptable to change the column type after the import. Probably the most common conversion is from a character string to a date. For this example, we’re just going to use some test data: bad_tibble &lt;- tibble::tribble(~bad_date, ~value, &quot;2012/01/01&quot;, 100, &quot;2014/06/01&quot;, 200) bad_tibble %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(good_date = as.Date(bad_date, format = &quot;%Y/%m/%d&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## bad_date value good_date ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 2012/01/01 100 2012-01-01 ## 2 2014/06/01 200 2014-06-01 Essentially, all you need to do is wrap your conversion function (e.g. as.Date(), as.character()) in a dplyr::mutate() call and you should be able to change your columns to whatever you need.
