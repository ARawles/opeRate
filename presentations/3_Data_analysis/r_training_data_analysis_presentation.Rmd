# Data Analysis in R

Adam Rawles

---

## Recap

--

- What is R and RStudio?

--

- Basic arithmetic operators

--

- Variable assigment

--

- Data types

--

- Data structures (including subsetting)

--

- Functions


---

## Overview

--

- Installing packages

--

- Loading data

--

- Cleaning data

--

- Summary statistics

--

- Graphs and plots

---

## Installing packages

- Packages provide extra functions and/or data to R (for example, the `stringr` package provides functions to help with text cleaning)

--

- Installing packages with RStudio is easy to do

--

- RStudio has a built-in interface for installing packages...
- Or, you can use the R function `install.packages()`, and provide the name of the package(s) you want to install to the function

--

```{r installing_packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))
```

--

- Packages must be loaded before they are available, via the `library()` function

--

```{r load_packages, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

- Note: if you close RStudio, you'll need to reload your packages.
- Think of installing the package being like installing a program, and the `library()` call as like opening it - you wouldn't open a program without installing it and you wouldn't use it without opening it!

---

## Using packages

- If you've loaded a pacakge via `library()`, then you don't need to do anything else before you use it.

--

- However, when using a non-base R function or if you haven't loaded the package, it's always a good idea to make it explicit what package it came from.

--

- We do that using `::`

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot2::ggplot()
```

--

- This will mean that anyone reading your code will know exactly what package a function came from

--

- It'll also ensure that you're using the function you mean to in the event that two packages have functions with the same name

---


## Loading data

--

- Data can be loaded into R in many formats

--

- The easiest of which are .xlsx or .csv files

--

- These can be loaded into R two different ways

--

   + The first is by using the `read.csv()`/`read.xlsx()` functions
   
--
  
>  + The `read.csv()` function takes a string of the file's path as it's only required input argument
  
--

>>  + But there are a number of optional arguments (e.g. `header`, `stringsAsFactor`,...)

--

>  + The `read.xlsx()` function requires both a path, and the index of the sheet you want from the workbook
  
---

## Loading data


- The second is to use RStudio's built in "Import Dataset" interface

--

   + This interface essentially just acts as a wrapper to the `read.csv()/xlsx()` functions
   + You'll see that when you run it, the code to import the data is run in the console

---

## Loading data - example


<div align="center">
<img src="data_excel.png">
</div>

---

## Loading data - example


```{r loading_data_example, echo = TRUE}
test_data <- read.csv("test_data.csv",
                      header = TRUE,
                      stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

head(test_data, n = 2)

```

---

## Loading data - exercise

--

- Using RStudio's "Import Dataset" or the `read.csv()` function, load the test_data dataset

---

## Data cleaning

--

- After the data is loaded into R, we need to make sure that each column is in the correct format (e.g. character, factor, numeric, etc.)

--

- This can be done two different ways:

--
    - You can either click on the dataframe in the Environment pane, which will open the dataframe in the Source pane

--

>   - From here, you can hover over the column headers to see what type the data is stored as
>    - Or, you can use the is.xxxxx functions to check from the console.

--

>      - To do this, you choose the appropriate function for the type you want (e.g. `is.numeric()`), and include the column you want to check as an argument...
        
---

## Data cleaning

```{r data_cleaning_1, echo = TRUE}

is.numeric(test_data$Income)
## we could also do is.numeric(test_data[,1]) as per our last session on subsetting

is.numeric(test_data$LeadDivsion)

is.factor(test_data$LeadDivision)

```

---

## Data cleaning


- If you want to get the type of a column without comparing it to other types, you use the `is()` function

--

- The first value returned from this function will tell you the data type of the column

```{r data_cleaning_2, echo = TRUE}
is(test_data$Firm)

is(test_data$Employees)

```

---

## Data cleaning


- If a column does not have the correct type, we can easily coerce the values into the type that we want

--

- The exact method is different depending on what you are converting from and to

--

- Generally speaking however, the method for converting a column type is:

```{r data_cleaning_3, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
dataframe$column <- as.xxxxx(dataframe$column)
```

---

## Data cleaning - exercise

--

- Convert the the Firm column from a factor to a character, and check your conversion worked

---


## Date cleaning - answer

```{r data_cleaning_exercise, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}

test_data$Firm <- as.character(test_data$Firm)

is.character(test_data$Firm)
```

---

## Data cleaning

- This method works well for:

--

   - Numeric/integer to character
    
--

   - Character to numeric/integer
    
--

   - Integer to numeric
    
--

   - Numeric to integer
    
--

   - Character to factor
    
--

   - Factor to character
    
--

   - Numeric to factor
   
--

- For factor to numeric, there's an extra step:

--
   
   - Before the factors levels can be converted, they need to be converted to characters first:

```{r data_cleaning_5, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

dataframe$column <- as.numeric(as.character(dataframe$column))

```

---

## Data cleaning - dates


- Dates in R can be tricky

--

   - R will not import date values in as dates unless you specify that it should
--

        - But RStudio's "Import Dataset" feature can be handy here...

--

   - If you don't, R will import them as characters (which means they'll be converted to factors unless you specify `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`)
   
--

- To convert a character to a date, use the `as.Date()` function...

---

## Data cleaning - dates (example)


```{r data_cleaning_dates, echo = TRUE}
datetest <- "12/12/2018"
datetest <- as.Date(datetest, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
is(datetest)
```

--

- To convert from a factor to a date, first convert to a character...

---

## Data cleaning - dates (exercise)


- Our `test_data$ReturnDate` column is currently a factor, convert it to date

--

- Remember to convert the column to character first!

---

## Data cleaning - dates(answer)

```{r data_cleaning_dates_exercise, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
test_data$ReturnDate <- as.character(test_data$ReturnDate)
test_data$ReturnDate <- as.Date(test_data$ReturnDate,
                                format = "%d/%m/%Y")
```

```{r data_cleaning_dates_exercise_alt, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
test_data$ReturnDate <- as.Date(as.character(test_data$ReturnDate),
                                format = "%d/%m/%Y")
```

---

## Data cleaning - dates 


- Dates can also come in numeric form, calculated as the number of days from a particular origin

--

- For example, a numeric value of 1, with an origin of 12/12/2018 would correspond to a date value of 13/12/2018

--

- If your date values are in numeric format, you need to specify the origin in the `as.Date()` function...

---

## Data cleaning - dates (example)


```{r data_cleaning_dateS_numeric, echo = TRUE}
datetest <- 17940
datetest <- as.Date(datetest,
                    origin = as.Date("01/01/1970",
                                     format = "%d/%m/%Y"))
datetest
```

---

## Data cleaning - dates


- With dates, you'll often need to specify the format (format codes can be found online and are included in your help sheet)

--

- There's no `is.Date()` function in base R

--

- So to check whether a value is a date, use `is()`

---

## Data cleaning - conclusion


- To find out the type of a column, use the `is()` function

--

- Otherwise, you can (usually) test if a column is a specific type via the is.xxxxx functions

--

- Converting between datatypes (except from numeric -> factor) is easy with the as.xxxxx functions

--

- When converting numbers to factors, convert them to characters first

--

- When converting from characters or numeric to dates, `as.Date()` requires "format" or "origin" parameters respectively 

---

## Summary statistics


- Before doing any in-depth analysis, it's always a good idea to get some descriptive statistics from your data

--

- This includes the mean, the median, the standard deviation, and the interquartile range, but the statistics you use will depend on your data

--

- Getting these values for each column is easy using the built-in functions R provides:

```{r summary_statistics_1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mean()
median()
sd()
quantile()
```

---

## Summary statistics - exercise


- Find the mean, median, standard deviation, and quantiles for our meter reading column

---

## Summary statistics - answers

```{r summary_statistics_exercise, echo = TRUE}
mean(test_data$Income)
median(test_data$Income)
sd(test_data$Income)
quantile(test_data$Income)
```

---

## Summary statistics


- More often than not however, you'll want summary statistics for more than one column, or maybe broken down by group

--

- R includes a function that will give you summary statistics for each column (the `summary()` function):

```{r summary_statistics_3, echo = TRUE}
summary(test_data)
```

---

## Summary statistics by group

- Summary statistics by group are a little bit more complicated as they require us to "apply" the function for each group

--

- To do that, we use the `tapply()` function. This will take the test_data dataset, split it according to the grouping we give, and then use whatever summary function we provide

--

```{r summary_statistics_by_group_1_hidden, eval = TRUE}
tapply(test_data$Income, test_data$LeadDivision, sd)
```

--

- So here we provide the Income column, say to split it up by Lead Division, and apply the `sd()` function
---

## Summary statistics by group - exercise

- Produce the mean income for each division

---

## Summary statistics by group - answer


```{r summary_stats_answer_2, eval = TRUE}
tapply(test_data$Income, test_data$LeadDivision, mean)
```

---

## Summary statistics - conclusion


- Producing summary statistics for columns in a dataframe can be done through the `mean()`, `median()`, `sd()`, and `quan tile()` functions (among others)

--

- Producing summary statistics for multiple columns can be done with the `summary()` function

--

- Producing summary statistics by group requires us to `apply` the `summary()` function to each group


---

## Plotting


- After calculating your summary statistics, it can be useful to visualise the data to better understand any trends or differences

--

- For example, we may want to see if there's a difference between the incomes for different divisions

--

- We could use a plot to visualise that difference

--

- There are two good ways to create plots
    - The first uses R's built-in plotting functions
    - The second uses a package called "ggplot2"
    
--

We're going to focus on base R for now


---

## Plotting


- R's main plotting function is `plot()`

--

- This function takes the data you want to visualise as it's only required argument, with optional arguments to specify what kind of plot you want

--

- If you don't specify what kind of plot you want, `plot()` tries to guess the most appropriate type of plot for your data, and creates it


---

## Plotting - example


- First off, let's plot the incomes of the divisions to see if there's a difference:

```{r plotting_example_1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
plot(x = test_data$LeadDivision, y = test_data$Income)
```

---

## Plotting - example

```{r plotting_example_1_hidden, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
plot(x = test_data$LeadDivision, y = test_data$Income)
```

---

## Plotting - example

- As you can see, we've specified our x and y axis, but not what type of plot we want

--

- But the `plot()` function has guessed that we probably want a boxplot

--

- Note: you can also force R to create a boxplot using the `boxplot()` function

---

## Plotting - example


- Next, we might want to see if there's a correlation between the income of a firm and the number of employees it has

--

- Again, we can use the plot function, specify our x and y axis, and R will guess what the best plot is

--

```{r plotting_example_2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
plot(x = test_data$Income, y = test_data$Employees)
```

---

## Plotting - example

```{r plotting_example_2_hidden, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
plot(x = test_data$Income, y = test_data$Employees)
```

---

## Plotting - example

- R has created a scatter plot by default, but we can change the type if we wish using the option "type" argument
- See your help sheet for the different types


---

## Plotting - exercise


- Create a plot of employees against Lead Divisions...

---

## Plotting - answer


```{r plotting_exercise, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
plot(x = test_data$LeadDivision, y = test_data$Employees)
```

---

## Histograms - example


- One of the best features of the plotting system in R is how easy it is to make histograms

--

- You can either use the `plot()` function and specify "h" as the type, or we can use the `hist()` function and provide one variable to produce a simple histogram...

--

```{r histograms, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
hist(test_data$Income)
```

---

## Histograms - example


```{r histograms_hidden, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
hist(test_data$Income)
```

---

## Customizing your graphs


- To make your graph easier to understand, you may want to...
    - Change the title
    - Change the axis labels
    - Change the points
    - Change the size of the bins for our histogram
    
--

- Note: These are a few of the customization options, but there are many, many more

---

## Customizing your graphs

- Change the title
    - To change the title, all we need to do is specify a "main" parameter in our plot function...
    
--
    
```{r customizing_graphs_title, eval = FALSE}
plot(test_data$Income, test_data$Employees,
     main = "Correlation between Income and # of Employees")
```

--

- Change the axis labels
    - To change the labels on the axes, we use the "xlab"/"ylab"" parameters...
    
--

```{r customizing_graphs_axis, eval = FALSE}
plot(test_data$Income, test_data$Employees,
     main = "Correlation between Income and # of Employees",
     xlab = "Income (£)",
     ylab = "Number of Employees")
``` 

---

## Customizing your graphs

- Changing the graph points
    - To change the points, we use the "pch" paremeter, and specify a value between 0 and 25...
    
--

```{r customizing_graphs_points, eval = FALSE}
plot(test_data$Income, test_data$Employees,
     main = "Correlation between Income and # of Employees",
     xlab = "Income (£)",
     ylab = "Number of Employees",
     pch = 19)
``` 

- Putting those all together...

---

## Customizing your graphs


```{r customizing_graphs_total, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
plot(test_data$Income, test_data$Employees,
     main = "Correlation between Income and # of Employees",
     xlab = "Income (£)",
     ylab = "Number of Employees",
     pch = 19)
``` 

---

## Customizing your graphs (histograms)


- In addition to the previous customization options, for histograms, we can change the size of the bins

--

   - To do this, we specify the "breaks" parameter in our `hist()` function
   
--

   - This splits up out our data into x number of bins of equal size
    
--

```{r customizing_graphs_hist, eval = FALSE}
hist(test_data$Income, breaks = 30)
```

---

## Customizing your graphs (histograms)


```{r customizing_graphs_hist_hidden, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width=c("50%", "50%"), fig.show='hold'}
hist(test_data$Income, breaks = 30)
hist(test_data$Income)
```

---

## Plotting - final exercise

- Create a plot of your choice, and change the title and axis labels.

---

## Plotting - conclusion

- In short, R has lots of in-built tools to make quick, simple graphs and plots

--

- Most types of graph only require a few input parameters, but there's lots of customization options

--

- In a later module, we'll look at a package called ggplot2, which we'll use to create more complex graphics

---
